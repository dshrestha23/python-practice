# Python Practice

This repository, `python-practice`, contains implementations of ciphers and other algorithms in Python.

## Contents

- [`caesar.py`](caesar.py): Implements the Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- [`vigenere.py`](vigenere.py): Implements the Vigenère Cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- [`luhn_algo.py`](luhn_algo.py): Implements the Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: ```markdown
# Python Practice: Cipher Algorithms

This repository, `python-practice`, contains implementations of three classic cipher algorithms in Python. Each algorithm demonstrates fundamental concepts in cryptography and can serve as a learning tool for those interested in encryption, decryption, and computer security.

## Contents

- [`caesar.py`](caesar.py): Implements the Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- [`vigenere.py`](vigenere.py): Implements the Vigenère Cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- [`transposition.py`](transposition.py): Implements the Transposition Cipher, where the positions held by units of plaintext (which are usually characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you will need Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dshrestha23/python-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd python-practice
   ```
3. Run the script of your choice. For example, to run the Caesar Cipher script:
   ```
   python caesar.py
   ```

## Usage

Each script can be executed independently. They are command-line applications, so you will interact with them through your terminal or command prompt. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.
