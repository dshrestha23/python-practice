# Python Practice

This repository, `python-practice`, contains implementations of ciphers, algorithms and other small projects in Python.

## Contents

- [`caesar.py`](caesar.py): Implements the Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- [`vigenere.py`](vigenere.py): Implements the Vigen√®re Cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- [`luhn_algo.py`](luhn_algo.py): Implements the Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers.
- [`build-an-arithmetic-formatter-project.py`](build-an-arithmetic-formatter-project): A simple program that arranges arithmetic problems vertically and horizontally. The program also has an option to show the answers to the problems.
- [`expense-tracker.py`](expense-tracker): A simple expense tracker program that allows users to add expenses, list all expenses, show total expenses, and filter expenses by category.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you will need Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dshrestha23/python-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd python-practice
   ```
3. Run the script of your choice. For example, to run the Caesar Cipher script:
   ```
   python caesar.py
   ```

## Usage

Each script can be executed independently. They are command-line applications, so you will interact with them through your terminal or command prompt. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the programs.
